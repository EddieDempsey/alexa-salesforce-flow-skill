FinancialForce Amazon Echo Skill for Salesforce Flow
==============================

This **Alexa Skill** is a working example of how to integrate the [Amazon Alexa Skill API] (https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interaction-model-reference#Slot%20Types) with the [Salesforce Visual Flow](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=vpm_admin_flow_overview.htm&language=en_US) tool via its [API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_vpm_guide.meta/salesforce_vpm_guide/vpm_distribute_system_rest.htm). Once in place you can **add voice integration to Salesforce through Flow and clicks not code**! 

You can read more about how we created it and how to [try it out for yourself in your own org](https://github.com/financialforcedev/alexa-salesforce-flow-skill/wiki/Setup-and-Configuration), in the following blog articles. We have also provided some example Flows that help you get started.
